Key Findings:

This HR Analytics Dashboard provides valuable insights into workforce trends:

Attrition Count: The dashboard displays the total number of employees who have left the organization within a specific timeframe (e.g., past month, quarter, year).
Employee Count: This metric shows the total number of current employees in the company.
Attrition Rate: The dashboard calculates the attrition rate as a percentage, reflecting the proportion of employees who have left compared to the total employee count within the specified timeframe. This provides a clear understanding of employee turnover.
Departmental Analysis:

The dashboard delves deeper by providing department-wise details on:

Average Age: This metric reveals the average age of employees within each department. Analyzing trends in average age can be helpful in understanding areas with potentially high turnover due to retirement or career stage changes.
Departmental Attrition: This section showcases the attrition count and attrition rate specifically for each department. Identifying departments with higher attrition rates allows for targeted focus on potential causes and retention strategies.
